### Answer about graceful degradation and service workers.

Graceful degradation and service workers are related because they follow the definition of graceful degradation. Graceful degradation implies building the most challenging parts first before moving down and building the broader and more general aspects. In this case, building service workers first is the most challenging part as it is setting up a cache to store specific images and links in this case. In order to apply it, we have to first create an instance of it and activate it. Once that is complete, then we can build the HTML files etc. that the service worker will deploy when we open the app. In this case, it works in doing its job and we had to build it using graceful degradation as we built the harder technological setup for it followed by the simpler connection to the HTML files.
